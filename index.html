                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Hong Wei Chen. I'm currently enrolled in Stony Brook University as a Computer Sciecne Sophomore. I created this personal website for fun during the summer of my Sophomore year in High School just to practice what I learned about HTML/CSS from KhanAcademy. Still pretty new to web design and I plan to learn more about how to implement Javascript into websites to complete my web development skillset. There's still a lot for me to learn but I plan to keep on going and become a badass programmer. My ultimate goal is to become expert in both front-end and back-end development. Now, let me show off as much as I can. No one will visit this site anyway.

                <h2>My Incredible Works</h2>
                <div>
                <img src="Abstract%20Fish.PNG" alt="Abstract Fish. A random fish painter program." width="200">
                <p>This is an intro to Javascript project I made on Khan Academy during my early stages of learning. The idea is that when the user clicks on the canvas, a fish with random size and color will be drawn on the position of the cursor. This lesson is about functions and how to call them with parameters. In this case, the parameter is the x and y position, which is provided by the user's mouse click. This worked out pretty well and I even took a screen shot of it and used it as my avatar for many websites. It's a piece of art made with Processing JS.</p>

                <img src="Shooting%20Star.PNG" alt="Shooting Star. A shooting star and explosion animation" width="200">
                <p>This one is also from the Intro to Javascript course on Khan Academy. I love their free courses, probably the best ones out there. Anyway, this is actually an animation using the draw function. I did this on the second day I started this course and it took me a solid 2 hours to finish. I went way pass the expectation and added a bunch of stuffs. At the end I was saying to myself, "Hey, this is fun!", and, "I'm a genius!". I finally realized how amazing and fun programming can be.</p>
